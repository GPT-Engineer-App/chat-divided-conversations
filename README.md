# chat-divided-conversations

A chat interface that can handle multiple conversations with the same person. You should be able to mark a conversation as closed, get a title of the topic of the conversation, be able to go back to previous ones, and preferably see which previous conversations might be linked to this one. So, instead of having just a long conversation with a person, or a customer, it should be divided into separate conversations.
